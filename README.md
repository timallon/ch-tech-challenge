So, I haven't had time to code for over a month and am struggling to remember what I know(?).

Initially I decided to use a generator, because that's what I used in projects. This was a bad decision for several reasons, but most of all because the Ironlauncher generator includes mongoose, and I had a problem throught the bootcamp in that I was never able to get mongoose to install locally. Throughout the course I used Mongo's remote server, and I was 90 minutes in to the challenge before I realised that this was unnecessary and I would not get much done after that.

Then I set up an Express server, but I have not got far at all, and have used this exercise mainly as an opportunity to re-learn and understand what is being asked, rather than to put into practice what I learnt on the bootcamp.

I'm at the point where I am not sure whether to use .ejs files, or whether I need .js in order for this to work when I implement React. Perhaps it makes no difference, but it's going to take me more time than I have left to read up on it and decide which approach to take.

To be continued :)
